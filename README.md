# Camera_eye_shutter
This project uses a camera lens to demonstrate how human eye reacts to different light conditions. The Iris is the pigmented part of the human eye(depending on your eye color). It has a muscle that contracts and relax. This process determines how much light is allowed through the pupil. Eg. In a dimmer light (such as a gloomy day) , the iris’s muscle will relax to let more light through but  in brighter light (such as a really sunny day)  the iris’s muscles will contract to let less light through the pupil. To demonstrate this in this project we have used a camera lens, servo motor, LDR (light dependent resistor), Arduino Nano and buck converter.
